# Capstone Project Instructions

The primary goal of this course is to equip you with skills to manipulate and integrate different data types and to introduce basic machine learning tools to address problems in oceanography. As part of the course, you will undertake an independent project which relates directly to your MS/PhD research. For your project, you will develop a machine learning model to predict values of a target variable that is challenging to measure directly over large areas or at high spatial/temporal resolution. Your model will utilise a set of other, easier to measure (or model) variables to predict your target variable. It is generally a good idea for these other variables to be quantities that are easier to measure directly or remotely than your target variable, or commonly produced as ocean circulation model output (some examples might be SST, salinity, chlorophyll, sea level). 

Your project should utilise data from a range of sources, including at least one outside source (i.e. not directly collected by you). I also expect to see some sensitivity analysis of models and model parameters to justify your ultimate choice of model algorithm and structure.

## Components of the capstone project
You will each create a github repository for your course project. The project is broken down into the following elements which will build towards your final project report.

### 1. Capstone Project Proposal (HW5)
(50 points, due **Friday 17th March, 5pm**)  
Details on this assignment [here](https://github.com/sophieclayton/OEAS805_envdatasci/blob/master/homework/HW5_capstone_proposal.md).

<!--### 2. Capstone Check-in (HW6)
(50 points, due **Wednesday April 5th, 5pm**)

The capstone check-in is intended to help keep you on track with your capstone project work, and to help flag any major roadblocks or identify needed changes in direction with time to address them before the end of the semester. Depending on whether you are working on a machine learning (supervised or unsupervised) project or a data wrangling project, you will include different elements in your check-in submission. 

Detailed information on the Capstone Check-in assignment can be found here.

Create a Jupyter notebook to perform exploratory data analysis for all of the different data types that you intend to use for your project. You should determine and describe with appropriate figures (don't forget axis labels, units, titles, etc...) and short paragraphs of text:

* A clear description of each data type with information on how to access it. If it's your own data, just state that, if you have accessed the data from some other source provide enough information for someone else to access it.
* The spatial and temporal coverage of each of your data types.
* The level of overlap in coverage and resolution of your different data types.

### 2. Class Presentations
(15% total course grade, **Tuesday 18th and Thursday 20th April**)  
Detailed instructions will be posted here.

### 3 Peer Review of Project Repositories
Required but ungraded (if not completed, your project repository will not receive a grade). Due **Friday 14th April**.

Each student will be assigned a peer's GitHub repository to review prior to the Project Repository submission deadline. This is intended to provide useful feedback to improve the accessibility of the code and documentation in your Project Repository by enlisting each other as "beta testers". Review assignments will not be reciprocal, i.e. you will not review the repository of the person who is reviewing your repository.

For this assignment, you will review the requirements listed below for the Project Repository and provide an informal review for your reviewee (and me) based on how well their repository meets the requirements listed below. This can be a simple Slack message, but you should thoroughly go through the repo.

### 4. Project Repository on GitHub
(15% total course grade, due **Friday 21st April**)

All of your code should be clearly organised in your project github repository. As a general guideline, you should provide sufficient background information and commenting in your repository and code for someone to replicate your analysis. Some specific requirements:

* Your repository **must** include a README that gives an overview of the project, instructions for using the code, and enough information to allow the user to access the data you used (this can be in an external shared folder, just make sure that you give me access!).
* You should include either a `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` file with the relevant package/version information.
* Your code should be adequately commented, including descriptions of key variables.
* Don't forget to list which version of python the code is written in as well as any and all packages you have used.

### 5. Project Report
(20% total course grade, due **Tuesday 25th April, 5pm**)

You will write up the results of your project as a final project report. Please treat this as you would a research paper, including: 

* Abstract (250 words max)
* Introduction
* Data 
* Methods
* Discussion 
* Conclusions 

Be sure to properly reference the relevant literature using a citation style of your choice (consistently).
The project report should be submitted as a pdf document using the following formatting: 

* 11-12 pt font
* Single spaced lines
* Include line and page numbers
* Figures and tables may be in line with the text and must numbered and include a title.
