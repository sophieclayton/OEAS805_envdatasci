# ODU Ocean Data
## OEAS895: Advanced Data Science Techniques in Ocean and Earth Sciences.

Oceanography is quickly moving from being a data-poor to a data-rich discipline. 

This is an advanced computational course designed to introduce students to data management, reproducibility and analysis methods commonly used in data science applications. The data analysis portion of the course will be primarily based on machine learning methods. The course will also give an overview of a selection of scientific databases which host freely available oceanographic data and output from numerical model simulations. This course is not discipline specific and will be useful for any students who want to work with data efficiently and gain experience in applying machine learning techniques.

## Learning objectives
1. Understand FAIR data principles and how to apply them when generating, sharing and accessing data.
2. Develop a working knowledge of existing ocean and earth science databases and how to efficiently access data from them.
3. Students will develop their own data analysis toolbox using, but not limited to, python and shell scripts.  
4. Understand and use version control (e.g. git) to manage and share code.
