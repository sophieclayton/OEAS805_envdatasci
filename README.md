## Course description
The Ocean, Earth and Environmental Sciences are quickly moving from being a data-poor to  data-rich disciplines, with many scientific and industry-related applications enabled by the analysis, synthesis and statistical modeling of large and diverse environmental data sets. 

This is an advanced computational analysis course designed to introduce students to data management and analysis methods commonly used in data science applications. The data analysis portion of the course will be primarily based on machine learning methods. The course will also give an overview of a selection of scientific databases which host freely available oceanographic data and output from numerical model simulations. This course is not discipline specific and will be useful for any students who want to work with data efficiently and gain experience in data management, proper techniques in developing analytical pipelines and applying machine learning to their research.

The class will meet two days a week, Tuesday and Thursday. Classes will consist of a combination of lectures, discussions and practical coding exercises where collaboration and teamwork will be encouraged. The outcome of the course will be an individual capstone project where each student applies the techniques learned during the course to undertake a data analysis project based on their own research interests using at least 2 different data sources from open scientific databases, and may include data that they have generated themselves. Students will be expected to publish the code developed and results of their project in a public GitHub repository. 

The course schedule can be found [here](https://github.com/sophieclayton/OEAS805_data_science/blob/master/OEAS895_AdvData_schedule.pdf), and the full course syllabus can be dowbloaded from [here].

## Learning objectives
1. Understand FAIR data principles and how to apply them when generating, sharing and accessing data.
2. Develop a working knowledge of existing ocean and earth science databases and how to efficiently access data from them, including via APIs.
3. Students will develop their own data analysis toolbox using, but not limited to, Python and shell scripts.  
4. Understand and use version control (e.g. git), environments (e.g. conda) and code repositories (e.g. GitHub) to manage and share code.
5. Understand the underlying principles of machine learning techniques for regressison and classification, including supervised and unsupervised learning and apply them to a targeted research question.
6. Understand the process of model evaluation and optimization and commonly used metrics for reporting model performance. 

## Capstone Project
The goal of the final capstone project is to assess students ability to combine and apply the skills learned in class in the context of a real-world research problem. The class will mostly focused on tools for data analysis, visualization and developing and evaluating machine learning models, so this will be the focus of the capstone project. Students must have the dataset(s) and general scope of their capstone project approved by the instructor prior to spring break.
